# screepsMachineLearning

Repo that focuses on using machine learning on data that comes out of screeps plus

Data is constructed using a modified version of screepsplus [node-agent](https://github.com/ScreepsPlus/node-agent) and the [screeps](https://github.com/LispEngineer/screeps) stats data collector
- These will appear in this repo at some point, glossing over them right now because they contain authentication information
